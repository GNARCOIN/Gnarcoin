### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

If you are gnarly and nobody is there to see it, are you really getting gnarly?

GNARCOIN is the first real-world P2P game, encouraging and rewarding gnarly undertakings. In essence, friends and community-players wager, reward and barter gnarcoins for achieving things deemed to be â€˜gnarâ€™ by the users themselves â€“ be this a genuinely gnarly snowboarding trick, a particularly difficult rock-climbing line or quite simply something outrageous and funny â€“ think â€˜naked daffy duck skiingâ€™. 

Primarily aimed towards the extreme-sport industry but by no means dependent on it â€“ we see that â€˜gnarlyâ€™ has a different meaning to everyone.
